# Exercise 1

An interactive fiction inspired by games like *System Shock* and *Prey* (2017). This is the first level, and mostly a skeleton, but the following things work:

- Functioning player and room inventories
- Interactive, non-movable items
- Locked paths with specific keys
- Two separate endings
- Characters with dialogue
  - I was looking to implement a branching dialogue system that would incorporate player choices, but didn't quite have enough time to get that pushed through. The groundwork is there, though.

In addition, the code features the following:

- Rudimentary exception handling
- Non-repetitive descriptive text (the room description will not repeat with every player action)
